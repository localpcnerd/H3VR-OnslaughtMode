# H3VR-OnslaughtMode
This is a custom gamemode I've been building for a couple weeks because I got tired of Take and Hold. Enjoy!

## Features
* Tracked Kills
* Timers
* Leaderboard (IN PROGRESS)
There are no restrictions on weapons, use whatever you think'll be fun. Want to use an M4? an M14? an M110? Doesn't matter.

# Custom Mapping Guide
prerequisites: Unity 5.6.3p + An existing [MeatKit](https://github.com/H3VR-Modding/MeatKit) project

Firstoff, download the latest release from the Releases section.

Next, drag and drop the .unitypackage file into your MeatKit project. 
Let everything import, and once done you should have a new folder titled **Onslaught**.

Open up **Onslaught/Scenes/OnslaughtExampleMap.unity** to further explore and modify the map.
For simpler maps, all you should need to do is remove the *Map-gameArea-mapGeo* gameobject and replace it with your own map. Obviously repositioning spawn and end areas may be needed as well, depending on the scale of your map.

For more complex map changes or if you'd just like more info, DM or ping me at **local pc nerd#5898**
